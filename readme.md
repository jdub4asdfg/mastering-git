# Hello Git

## Standard workflow
1) Clone the repository by using 'git remote add origin -url-'

2) Create a branch using 'git branch -name-' and cd into it using 'git checkout -name-'

3) Push the branch to the remote repository using 'git push --set-upstream origin -name-'

4) Make your changes

5) Push your changes using 'git add .', 'git commit -m  '-message-', 'git push'

6) Create a pull request

7) Merge the changes

8) Pull changes to your local main branch using 'git pull'

## Handling merge conflicts
1) Merge changes from the main branch into the branch that you are currently in using 'git merge main'

2) Check out the versioning system on your editor to see merge conflicts

3) Figure out which lines of code you want to keep and apply changes

4) Repeat steps 5 to 8 of your standard workflow
